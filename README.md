<h1>Assignment</h1>

<ol>

 <li>Write a program in C where you would perform the following tasks:

  <ol start="5">

   <li>Declare a integer variable <em>a</em> whose value is 15, and another integer <em>p</em> whose value is 5.</li>

   <li>Make a call to function myP<em>ower() </em>whose arguments are the integer value <em>a </em>and power value <em>p</em>. This function should return an integer value which you will assign to another integer value <em>b </em>which should be equal to <em>a</em> raised to <em>p</em>.

    <ol>

     <li>You need to write your own function <em>myPower()</em></li>

     <li>Ask your instructor how to write a function in C. iii. Do not use standard C function that calculates power. Instead write your own <em>for</em> loop that calculates power.</li>

     <li>Print a statement that looks similar to the following replacing <em>a</em>, <em>p</em> and <em>b</em> with their respective values.</li>

    </ol></li>

  </ol></li>

</ol>

a raised to the power p is b

<ol start="2">

 <li>Write a C program to count the number of symbols that represent mathematical operations in a string. Mathematical operations include %, &amp;, *, +, -, /, &lt;, &gt;, =, ^ and ~. You can define the string in your program as a character array. For demonstration purpose, your output should exactly look like following.</li>

</ol>

String: Do 42+53/76%8=2*8-32+71 &amp; you can sleep. Contains: The string contains 8 symbols that represent mathematical operations.
